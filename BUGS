Perltidy open BUGS
    You can help perltidy evolve into a better program. If you think you
    have hit a bug or weird behavior, or have a suggested improvement,
    please send a note to perltidy at users.sourceforge.net.

    This file only lists open bugs. For bugs which have been fixed, see the
    ChangeLog.

  The --extrude option can produce code with syntax errors
    The --extrude tries to put as many newlines in the formatted code as
    possible. This option is very useful for testing perltidy but not for
    actual formatting. Occasionally it will produce code which Perl
    considers to have a syntax error. These problems usually involve code
    where Perl is having to guess the tokenization based on whitespace.
    Since the --extrude option is typically only used for testing perltidy,
    this type of error should not normally occur in practice.

  In some rare instances the formatting can oscillate between two states
    The following example was sent by Denis Moskowitz, Oct 29 2010:

    grep { $_->foo ne 'bar' } # asdfa asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf
    asdf asdf asdf @baz;

    With standard parameters this oscillates between the above and:

    grep { $_->foo ne 'bar' } # asdfa asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf
    asdf asdf asdf @baz;

    A workaround here would be to make a slight change to the side comment
    length.
