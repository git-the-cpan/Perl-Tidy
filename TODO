Perltidy TODO List
    This is a partial "wish-list" of features to add and things to do.

  -b does not work through the Tidy module
    The use of -b in the following does not work:

       use Perl::Tidy ();
       use File::Spec;

       my $file = File::Spec->catfile( $dir,
          $filename );

       Perl::Tidy::perltidy(
          source     => $file,
          argv        => '-b',
          perltidyrc => $perltidyrc,
       );

    A temporary workaround is:

       Perl::Tidy::perltidy(
          argv        => "-b $file",
          perltidyrc => $perltidyrc,
       );

  Improved Vertical Alignment
    There are still many opportunities for improving vertical alignment.

  Documentation
    A FAQ is needed to explain some of the more subtle formatting issues,
    and to give examples of different styles.

    The -formatter callback object documentation is incomplete.

  HTML writer
    The HTML writer does not colorize interpolated identifiers in here
    documents or quoted strings. The tokenizer outputs interpolation
    information for here docs; it still needs to be updated to do this for
    multi-line quotes. Then code needs to be written to scan for and markup
    identifiers.

Things which have been suggested but will not be done
  Recursive file processing
    A -r flag might be nice, but this is best handled by an exterior shell
    script.
